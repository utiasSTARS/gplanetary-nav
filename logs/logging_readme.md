# Logging directory

This is where all the logs generated through the notebooks and scripts are saved. To avoid log file accumulation, whenever a new kernel is started, the new log file will overwrite the previous one with the same name. Deleting `.log` files should not cause any issues either.

Do not delete this README file - it forces git to push/pull the current directory (all `.log` files are gitignored).
